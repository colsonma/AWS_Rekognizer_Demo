# AWS_Rekognizer_Demo
First thanks to Ben Snively and Rob Nolen for all their help with this. This is a quick demo of AWS rekognizer a photo analytics and recognition service, tied to a slackbot. A photo upload to slack triggers rekognizer to post in Slack about what the image is or what's recognized. In turn there is an S3 copy of the image which then triggers a lambda function to check the photo against a watchlist bucket. If the photo is matched this queues an MQTT thread to be posted to a thing shadow in AWS IoT which is connected to a Phillips Hue Controller managing a Hue Go light. It turns the light from Green to Red signaling that the person is on a watchlist. In order to clear that alert an Amazon Dot is used with a custom Alexa skill to trigger a Lambda function that posts a clear message back to the MQTT thread. There will be future iterations of this so stay tuned
